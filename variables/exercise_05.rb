=begin
Look at the following programs...

What does x print to the screen in each case? 
Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
=end

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

# and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

=begin
The first prints 3 to the screen. The second throws an error 
undefined local variable or method because x is not available 
as it is created within the scope of the do/end block.
=end
